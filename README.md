# GuessTheFlag - A Flag Recognition Game

## Overview
'GuessTheFlag' is a fun, interactive game developed during the '100 Days of SwiftUI' course. The app challenges players to identify the country of origin for various flags. It's a simple yet engaging way to test your knowledge of world flags.

## Features
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players are presented with a random flag and must guess the country it represents from multiple options.
- **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of the player's score, awarding points for correct guesses and deducting for incorrect ones.
- **UI Enhancements**: The app uses animations and visual effects like 3D rotation, opacity changes, and scale effects to enhance the user experience.

## Technical Highlights
- **SwiftUI Views**: Utilized various SwiftUI views including `Image`, `Button`, `VStack`, `HStack`, and `ZStack`.
- **Custom View Modifiers**: Applied modifiers like `.clipShape()`, `.shadow()`, and `.overlay()` to style the flag images.
- **Animations**: Integrated SwiftUI animations to provide feedback on user interaction.
- **Accessibility**: Ensured the app is accessible, with descriptive labels for screen readers.
- **Gradient Backgrounds**: Experimented with different gradient types like `LinearGradient`, `RadialGradient`, and `AngularGradient` to create visually appealing backgrounds.

## Reflections
- **Design and User Experience**: This project allowed me to focus on the app's design aspects, understanding how different SwiftUI views and modifiers can create an attractive and functional interface.
- **Animations and Interactivity**: Learned to use animations in SwiftUI to make the app more dynamic and interactive.
- **Accessibility**: Gained insights into making apps accessible, ensuring all users can enjoy the app regardless of their ability.

Note: This app was a tutorial project from the ["100 Days of SwiftUI" course](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) and was designed and implemented by me as part of my learning journey in iOS development.
